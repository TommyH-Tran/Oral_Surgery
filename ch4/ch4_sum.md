# 4 Wound Repair

An understanding of normal tissue repair is essential for dental surgeons to control pathologic and traumatic tissue damage and promote wound healing.

## Wound Repair

### Epithelialization
*   **Definition:** The genetically programmed regenerative ability of injured epithelium to reestablish its integrity through proliferation, migration, and contact inhibition.
*   **Mechanism:** Germinal epithelial cells at the wound edge proliferate and migrate forward. Migration ceases when the cells make contact with another free epithelial edge, signaling an end to lateral growth.
*   **Healing Surface Wounds (Abrasions):** Epithelium proliferates from rete pegs and adnexal tissues to cover the wound bed.
*   **Healing Subepithelial Wounds:** Epithelium proliferates across a vascularized tissue bed, beneath the superficial blood clot (scab), until it meets another epithelial margin. The scab then dislodges.
*   **Detrimental Effect:** Epithelialization can be detrimental, such as when oral and sinus mucosa proliferate and meet across an opening, creating an oroantral fistula.
*   **Therapeutic Use:** Surgeons can denude oral mucosa (e.g., unattached gingiva) in preprosthetic procedures, allowing adjacent attached gingiva to epithelialize the wound bed, a process known as reepithelialization.

## Stages of Wound Healing
Regardless of the cause, nonepithelial tissue injury initiates a stereotypical healing process consisting of three basic stages: (1) inflammatory, (2) fibroplastic, and (3) remodeling.

### Inflammatory Stage
*   **Onset & Duration:** Begins at the moment of injury and lasts for 3 to 5 days if unimpeded. This stage is sometimes called the *lag phase* because little collagen is deposited, and significant wound strength is not yet gained. The wound is held together by fibrin, which has little tensile strength.
*   **Phases:**
    1.  **Vascular Phase:**
        *   An initial vasoconstriction of disrupted vessels promotes blood coagulation.
        *   Within minutes, vasodilation occurs, mediated by histamine and prostaglandins E1 and E2 released from white blood cells.
        *   Endothelial spaces open, allowing plasma and leukocytes to leak into the interstitial tissues. Fibrin from the plasma obstructs lymphatics, leading to *edema*, which helps dilute contaminants.
        *   `![](_page_1_Figure_22.jpeg)`
    2.  **Cellular Phase:**
        *   Triggered by serum complement activation (C3a and C5a) which acts as chemotactic factors for leukocytes.
        *   **Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils)** marginate, undergo diapedesis, and degranulate, releasing proteases that destroy bacteria, foreign materials, and necrotic tissue.
        *   **Monocytes (macrophages)** phagocytize foreign and necrotic materials to clear debris.
        *   **Lymphocytes** accumulate at the injury site over time.
*   **Cardinal Signs of Inflammation:**
    *   Redness (erythema) & Swelling (edema) — *rubor et tumour*
    *   Warmth & Pain — *cum calore et dolore*
    *   Loss of function — *functio laesa*
    *   These signs are caused by vasodilation (warmth, erythema), fluid transudation (swelling), and the chemical/pressure effects of histamine, kinins, prostaglandins, and edema (pain, loss of function).
*   `![](_page_2_Figure_11.jpeg)`

### Fibroplastic Stage
*   **Onset & Duration:** Begins as fibrin strands from coagulation form a latticework and normally lasts 2 to 3 weeks.
*   **Fibroblast Activity:** Around day 3-4 post-injury, fibroblasts (transformed from pluripotential mesenchymal cells) begin laying down ground substance (mucopolysaccharides) and tropocollagen, which cross-links to form collagen. Fibroblasts also secrete fibronectin, which stabilizes fibrin, helps recognize foreign material, acts as a chemotactic factor for other fibroblasts, and guides macrophages for fibrin phagocytosis.
*   **Neovascularization:** New capillaries bud from existing vessels and run along the fibrin strands to cross the wound.
*   **Fibrinolysis:** Plasmin, brought by the new capillaries, removes superfluous fibrin strands.
*   **Collagen Deposition:** Collagen is initially deposited excessively and haphazardly, but it rapidly increases the wound's strength.
*   **Tension Effects:**
    *   Early in this stage, a wound under tension will pull apart along the initial line of injury.
    *   Later, it will open along the junction of old and newly deposited collagen.
*   **Clinical Appearance:** At the end of this stage, the wound appears stiff (due to excess collagen) and erythematous (due to high vascularization).
*   **Wound Strength:** The wound reaches 70% to 80% of the strength of uninjured tissue.
*   `![](_page_2_Figure_13.jpeg)`
*   `![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)`

### Remodeling Stage
*   **Onset & Duration:** This final stage, also known as *wound maturation*, continues indefinitely.
*   **Collagen Remodeling:** Haphazardly laid collagen fibers are removed and replaced by new fibers oriented to better resist tensile forces.
*   **Wound Strength:** Strength increases slowly during this phase but will never reach more than 80% to 85% of the strength of uninjured tissue.
*   **Scar Maturation:** The scar softens as excess collagen is removed, and erythema diminishes as vascularity decreases due to lessened wound metabolism. Elastin is not replaced, leading to a loss of flexibility in scarred skin and ligaments.
*   **Wound Contraction:**
    *   **Timing:** Begins near the end of the fibroplastic stage and continues during early remodeling.
    *   **Mechanism:** The edges of a wound migrate toward each other, diminishing its size. This is beneficial in reducing the size of the wound.
    *   **Detrimental Effects:** Can cause deforming and debilitating contractures, especially in full-thickness burns, and can create tissue mounds on the concave side of sharply curved lacerations.
    *   **Intervention:** Contraction can be lessened by placing an epithelial layer between free wound edges, such as using skin grafts on bared periosteum.

## Surgical Significance of Wound-Healing Concepts
Surgeons aim to create conditions that either augment or impede natural wound repair. Adherence to surgical principles optimizes healing, reestablishes tissue continuity, minimizes scar size, and restores function. Since no wound in skin, oral mucosa, or muscle heals without a scar, the surgeon's goal is to produce an inconspicuous scar that minimizes functional compromise, not to prevent scar formation.

## Factors That Impair Wound Healing
Four key factors can impair wound healing in an otherwise healthy individual.

#### Foreign Material
*   **Definition:** Any material the host's immune system recognizes as "non-self," including bacteria, dirt, and suture material.
*   **Problems Caused:**
    1.  Acts as a haven for bacteria, sheltering them from host defenses and promoting infection.
    2.  Can be antigenic, stimulating a chronic inflammatory reaction that decreases fibroplasia.
    3.  Bacterial proliferation releases proteins that destroy host tissue.

#### Necrotic Tissue
*   **Problems Caused:**
    1.  Acts as a physical barrier, impeding the ingrowth of reparative cells and prolonging the inflammatory stage.
    2.  Serves as a protected niche and nutrient source for bacteria.

#### Ischemia
*   **Definition:** A decreased blood supply to a wound.
*   **Interference with Repair:**
    *   Leads to further tissue necrosis.
    *   Lessens the delivery of antibodies, white blood cells, and antibiotics, increasing infection risk.
    *   Decreases the delivery of oxygen and nutrients essential for cellular metabolism and healing.
*   **Causes:** Tight sutures, poorly designed flaps, excessive external or internal pressure (e.g., hematomas), systemic hypotension, peripheral vascular disease, and anemia.

#### Tension
*   **Definition:** Any force that tends to hold wound edges apart.
*   **Problems Caused:**
    *   Sutures used to forcefully pull tissues together can constrict blood vessels, causing ischemia.
    *   If sutures are removed prematurely from a wound under tension, it is likely to reopen.
    *   If sutures are left in too long, suture tracts can epithelialize, leaving permanent marks. The wound may still spread during the remodeling stage.

## Healing by Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Intention

#### Healing by Primary Intention
*   **Definition:** Occurs when wound edges with no tissue loss are placed and stabilized in their original anatomic position.
*   **Mechanism:** Minimal reepithelialization, collagen deposition, contraction, and remodeling are needed.
*   **Outcome:** Rapid healing with minimal scar tissue and a lower risk of infection.
*   **Examples:** Well-repaired lacerations or incisions; well-reduced bone fractures.
*   **Note:** This is a theoretical ideal; clinically, it refers to wounds that are closely reapproximated.

#### Healing by Secondary Intention
*   **Definition:** Occurs when a gap is left between wound edges or when tissue loss prevents approximation.
*   **Mechanism:** Requires a large amount of epithelial migration, collagen deposition, contraction, and remodeling to fill the gap.
*   **Outcome:** Slower healing with more scar tissue formation.
*   **Examples:** Extraction sockets, poorly reduced fractures, deep ulcers, and large avulsive soft tissue injuries.

#### Healing by Tertiary Intention
*   **Definition:** Refers to the healing of large wounds by using tissue grafts to cover the wound and bridge the gap between wound edges.

## Healing of Extraction Sockets
Extraction sockets heal by secondary intention, following the typical sequence of inflammation, epithelialization, fibroplasia, and remodeling.

*   **Initial State:** The empty socket fills with a blood coagulum, sealing it from the oral environment.
*   **First Week:**
    *   The inflammatory stage begins, with white blood cells clearing bacteria and debris.
    *   Fibroplasia starts, with fibroblasts and capillaries growing into the clot.
    *   Epithelium migrates down the socket wall.
    *   Osteoclasts accumulate along the crestal bone.
*   **Second Week:**
    *   The socket is largely filled with granulation tissue.
    *   Osteoid deposition begins along the alveolar bone lining the socket.
*   **Third and Fourth Weeks:**
    *   Most sockets are fully epithelialized.
    *   Cortical bone is resorbed from the crest and socket walls as new trabecular bone is laid down across the socket.
*   **4 to 6 Months:** The cortical bone lining the socket is usually fully resorbed, causing the distinct lamina dura to disappear on radiographs.
*   **After 1 Year:** Only a rim of fibrous (scar) tissue remains on the edentulous alveolar ridge.

## Bone Healing
Bone healing follows a process similar to soft tissue healing but involves osteoblasts and osteoclasts for bone reconstitution and remodeling.

> <sup>\*</sup>The term *fracture* used with respect to bone repair includes not only traumatically injured bone, but also bone cuts purposely made by a surgeon during reconstructive surgery.

*   **Sources of Osteogenic Cells (Osteoblasts):**
    1.  Periosteum
    2.  Endosteum
    3.  Circulating pluripotential mesenchymal cells
*   **Osteoclasts:** Derived from monocyte precursors, these cells resorb necrotic bone and bone that requires remodeling.
*   **Osteoblasts:** Lay down osteoid, which calcifies if the site is immobile during healing.

#### Healing by Secondary Intention
*   **Conditions:** Occurs when fractured bone ends are more than 1 mm apart.
*   **Process:** A large amount of collagen is laid down to bridge the gap. Fibroblasts and osteoblasts produce a large fibrous matrix that extends beyond the bone ends, forming a **callus**. This callus eventually ossifies.
*   **Remodeling:** The haphazardly produced bone is resorbed by osteoclasts, and new bone is laid down by osteoblasts along lines of tension.
*   `![](_page_5_Figure_8.jpeg)`
*   `![](_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)`

#### Healing by Primary Intention
*   **Conditions:** Occurs in incomplete fractures ("greenstick fractures") or when fractured ends are closely reapproximated and rigidly stabilized (anatomic reduction).
*   **Process:** Minimal fibrous tissue is produced, and the bone reossifies quickly with little to no callus formation.
*   **Surgical Example:** Anatomic reduction of a fracture and application of bone plates to hold the ends rigidly together.

#### Factors Important to Proper Bone Healing
1.  **Vascularity:** A highly vascular environment with normal oxygen content is required for the fibrous connective tissue at a fracture site to ossify. Compromised vascularity or oxygen leads to cartilage formation or fibrous tissue that fails to ossify.
2.  **Immobility:**
    *   **Beneficial Tension:** Continuous, low-grade tension stimulates osteoblastic bone formation.
    *   **Excessive Movement:** Too much tension or torque at the fracture site compromises vascularity, favors cartilage or fibrous tissue formation over bone, and promotes infection.
*   `![](_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)`

### Implant Osseointegration
Osseointegration is the process where an inert foreign material develops a biologic bond with surrounding bone, which resists epithelial migration down the implant surface. This provides stable metal posts (implants) for dental and facial prostheses.

`![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)`

Wound healing around a pure titanium dental implant involves two factors:

1.  **Healing of bone to the implant (must occur first):**
    *   **Maximizing Bone Integration:** Successful osseointegration depends on bone deposition occurring before soft tissue can cover the implant surface. This requires four factors:
        1.  **A short distance between bone and implant:** Achieved by precise implant site preparation.
        2.  **Viable bone at or near the implant surface:** Preserved by minimizing heat damage during preparation (using sharp instruments, limiting cutting speeds, and cooling with irrigation) and controlling infection.
        3.  **No movement of the implant during healing:** Achieved with threaded or tight-fitting implants, countersinking, and low-profile healing screws.
        4.  **A contaminant-free implant surface:** Implants should not be handled with bare fingers or dissimilar metals.
    *   **Mechanism of Osseointegration:** The implant's titanium oxide layer is coated with glycosaminoglycans, onto which osteoblasts secrete osteoid. Superficial nonviable bone from surgical trauma acts as a scaffold and is slowly replaced by new, viable cortical bone through a process called **creeping substitution**.
    *   **Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR):** Woven membranes can be used to exclude fibroblasts and soft tissue, allowing nutrients to reach the bone while guiding bone formation toward the implant.

2.  **Healing of alveolar soft tissue to the implant:**
    *   Oral epithelium migrating toward a titanium abutment stops and secretes a ground substance that attaches to the metal.
    *   A hemidesmosomal, basal lamina system forms, strengthening the soft tissue attachment.

## Facial Neuropathology of Traumatic Origin
Injuries to maxillofacial sensory nerves can occur from fractures or surgery. Most recover spontaneously, but surgical advances can improve outcomes.

> \*The terms *distal* and *proximal* used in the description of nerves and bones refer to positions farthest away from (i.e., distal) or nearest to (i.e., proximal) the central nervous system. In this case, distal is not used in the same sense as is common when referring to teeth and the dental arch.

### Nerve Healing
Nerve healing typically involves two phases: degeneration and regeneration.

#### Degeneration
1.  **Segmental Demyelination:** The myelin sheath dissolves in segments while the axon remains intact. This slows or prevents nerve conduction, causing symptoms like paresthesia or hypoesthesia. It may undergo spontaneous regeneration.
2.  **Wallerian Degeneration:** The axon and myelin sheath distal to a nerve trunk interruption completely disintegrate. This stops all nerve conduction but is also likely to undergo spontaneous regeneration.

`![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)`

#### Regeneration
*   **Mechanism:** Almost immediately after injury, the proximal nerve stump sends out axonal sprouts (a growth cone) that grow down the remnant Schwann cell tube at a rate of 1 to 1.5 mm/day.
*   **Outcome:** Regeneration continues until the innervated site is reached or it is blocked by scar tissue. As functional contacts are made, patients may experience paresthesias or dysesthesias in previously anesthetic areas.
*   **Traumatic Neuroma:** If the Schwann cell tube is disrupted, the growth cone may meet fibrous connective tissue and form a mass of aimless nerve fibers, creating a painful traumatic neuroma.

#### Commonly Injured Trigeminal Nerve Branches
1.  **Inferior alveolar-mental nerve:** Injured by mandibular fractures, preprosthetic surgery, sagittal split osteotomies, and removal of impacted third molars.
2.  **Lingual nerve:** Injured during surgery to remove oral malignancies or impacted third molars.

### Classification
Understanding the type of nerve injury is crucial, as early surgical intervention is often more successful. Determination is usually retrospective.

`![](_page_10_Picture_1.jpeg)`

1.  **Neurapraxia (Least Severe):** A nerve contusion where the epineural sheath and axons remain intact (Fig. 4.11A). Caused by blunt trauma or stretching. Prognosis is spontaneous full recovery in days or weeks.
2.  **Axonotmesis (Moderate):** Axonal continuity is disrupted, but the epineural sheath is intact (Fig. 4.11B). Caused by severe blunt trauma or crushing. Axonal regeneration may resolve dysfunction in 2-6 months.
3.  **Neurotmesis (Most Severe):** Complete loss of nerve continuity (Fig. 4.11C). Caused by severe fractures or severance. Prognosis for spontaneous recovery is poor unless the nerve ends are closely approximated and properly oriented.

### Nerve Repair
Microneurosurgery is indicated for a lack of spontaneous recovery, often due to neuroma formation.

#### Inferior Alveolar Nerve Injury Repair Protocol:
1.  **Access:** A bony osteotomy is performed to expose the nerve (Fig. 4.12A).
2.  **Inspection:** The nerve is decompressed and inspected for a neuroma.
3.  **Neuroma Resection:** If a neuroma is found, it is resected (Fig. 4.12B).
4.  **Nerve End Repair:** The epineurium is reapproximated with fine sutures (epineurial repair) (Fig. 4.12C). If a tension-free repair is not possible, an autogenous or allogeneic nerve graft is used to bridge the gap.
5.  **Adjunctive Treatment:** Systemic medications (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists) may be used to control neuropathic symptoms like dysesthesia.
